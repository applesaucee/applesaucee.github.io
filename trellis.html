                <h2>Project Details</h2>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Team: Tamanh Nguyen, Eden Ghirmai, Christina Polyukh, Kristen Wei</li>
                       <li>Time: 5 Months</li>
                       <li>Role: Lead UX and Visual Designer, Lead Researcher</li>
                       <li>Tools Used: Sketch, Adobe Illustrator, Paper Prototypes, Google Forms, ATLAS.ti</li>
                   </ul>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Trellis is an Android application designed to help students with depression by connecting those that want support (supportees), to those that want to support them (supporters).</p>
                    <p>Our hard work paid off the evening of our Capstone event, where we were given <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/news/2016/11/capstone-showcases-more-300-students-work">Runner Up in the Research Award category</a>.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                   <h3>Research</h3>
                       <p>Academic articles were read in order to gain basic knowledge surrounding depression before conducting interviews with leading psychologists at the University of Washington, the school’s counseling center, and those with depression.</p>
                       <p>A qualitative heavy Google Forms survey was also posted to several university subreddits, and shared through our team member’s social media accounts. In a period of 50 hours, 639 responses were submitted.</p>
                       <p>I lead the team in coding responses with ATLAS.ti, analyzing trends/recurring themes, and summarizing what we found.</p>
                       <h4>Insights:</h4>
                           <ul>
                               <li>Many students were experiencing both anxiety and depression.</li>
                               <li>Having friends/family to talk to as a support network was the most helpful method of tackling depression.</li>
                               <li>Cost acted as the number one deterrent to getting help, followed by wanting to avoid the stigma, not thinking they needed help, and being scared of what could happen if they sought help.</li>
                               <li>Many wish they had a more supportive network: someone that understood what they were going through and wouldn’t judge them for it.</li>
                               <li>For those that had friends with depression, many were unsure how to talk to them or confront them about it. They didn’t want to think they were judging them.</li>
                           </ul>
                       <p>Based on interviews, the following personas were created:</p>
                       <ul>
                           <li><b>Sara Spice</b>, 18:<br />Cannot afford to seek professional help, but wants to find a way to cope with what she believes is depression.</li>
                           <li><b>Jordan Jones</b>, 20:<br />An ROTC student on a scholarship. She doesn't want to confront or admit she may have depression, for fear of losing her scholarship.</li>
                           <li><b>Mario Meng</b>, 22:<br />Believes that he's been struggling with depression since high school. He knows that culturally, his family doesn't believe in mental health issues.</li>
                           <li><b>Maxine Martinez</b>, 21:<br>She doesn't have depression, but has noticed that her roommate has been extremely apathetic. She's concerned about him, but isn't sure how to approach the topic with him. Her main goal is to learn more.</li>
                       </ul>
                    

                   <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                     <p>A romp through the Android and iOS app store allowed us to explore existing mental health applications: Pacifica, Headspace, 7CupsofTea, Happify, and SAM.</p> 
                     <p>These apps were geared towards coping with anxiety—not depression—and offered gamified ways of dealing with it.</p>
                     <p>Apps that claimed to support depression offered counseling services with “trained volunteers,” but our experience testing these apps out resulted in poor conversations that seemed to infuriate rather than help.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Conceptual Design</h3>
                    <p>Based on our research insights, we sought to create an app with the following features:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Connect those that want support, to those they know that want to give support.</li>
                        <li>Use Facebook as a way to connect supporters and supportees. This way, it'd be possible to search through a user’s friend’s list to identify who also has the app. That way, those you interface with are your friends.</li>
                        <li>Supportees are given the option to make themselves anonymous when they message supporters. This allows them to get help from someone they trust while simultaneously avoiding the “stigma.”</li>
                        <li>A “Learn More” section featuring curated articles about depression. The more you know, the better equipped you are to help others.</li>
                        <li>“Conversation Starters” to help start a conversation (because sometimes, you’re just at a loss for something to say).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We sketched out several ideas, and created paper prototypes which we later used for usability testing. Take a look at our <a href="../files/Prototype-and-Testing.pdf">paper prototype and usability test results here</a>.</p>
                   
                <h3>Hi-Fi Mockups</h3>
                <p>Hi-Fi Mockups can be found <a href="../files/Mockups.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                    
                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Technology probably won’t help solve depression, but it can certainly help open up conversations about it.</li>
                       <li>In times of extreme frustration, remember to breathe and be patient.</li>
                       <li>Designing in a bubble by yourself, whether visually or for UX,  is hard. Go out there and constantly ask for feedback from anyone and everyone.</li>
                       <li>Diversifying your time between an iOS and Android device will probably be better for creating mockups in the long run.</li>
                   </ul>
