                       <li>Team: Tamanh Nguyen</li>
                       <li>Time: 3 Months</li>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Math Adventure is a non-profit dedicated to promoting STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) within elementary schools. For one night, they concoct an interactive theatrical experience where students do math and have fun.</p>
                    <p>As part of my Content Strategy class, we were tasked with “making the website better.”</p>
                    <p>Our primary stakeholder reported that while they had a website, they were still constantly fielding questions and event registration via email. Their website was also on the second page of Google, which essentially meant they were non-existent.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                   <h3>Content Inventory and Stakeholder Interview</h3>
                       <p>To understand what needed to be improved, I spent some time doing a basic content inventory of Math Adventure and explored a few of its social media outlets.</p>
                       <p>My initial content inventory <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XwCUgMoa4498GFed9QX_XOfbQE-y6lcFrO8iIac5A34/edit?usp=sharing">can be found here</a>. I also <a href="../files/Math-Adventure-Sitemap.pdf"> created a sitemap</a> to better visualize the structure of the site as well.</p>
                       <p>Through this initial survey, I discovered that:</p>
                           <ul>
                               <li>The site had duplicate pages/redundant information.</li>
                               <li>Most pages had thin content.</li>
                               <li>Not all of their forms of social media were used to the same degree.</li>
                           </ul>
                        
                       <p>My professor also brought in our chief stakeholder to speak with us about Math Adventure—what it is, what they do, what they’d like to branch out to, etc. This gave me a better idea of what Math Adventure was as an organization, and the sort of brand/identity they embodied.</p>
                       <p>Based on the interview, the client had two goals:</p>
                           <ul>
                               <li>Expand event programming, both in type and number, and to a wider range of audiences in the Seattle area, and</li>
                               <li>Create a do-it-yourself program for schools outside of Seattle.</li>
                           </ul>
                       <p>To achieve this, the following project objectives were established:</p>
                           <ul>
                               <li>Increase website fundability to increase audience reach, both in terms of relevant content and terms for site visitors and SEO.</li>
                               <li>Clarify messaging across channels, starting with website, to educate potential customers and users and reduce high-touch communication.</li>
                               <li>Ensure the website is functional with appropriate content as well as navigation and flow that facilitates business goals, business processes, and user needs.</li>
                           </ul>
                       <p>The bulk of my work moving forward was focused on the last two bullets. Given the time frame of the course, my professor supplied us with the personas we would be working with.</p>

                   <h3>Comparative (Competitive) Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I did a comparative analysis with four other math related organizations: My Eye Level Bellevue, Girls Rock Math, Launch Math, and Zeno Math.  (It’s “comparative” because Math Adventure is a non-profit that isn’t “competing” for profit with other organizations.)</p>
                    <p>Although Math Adventure wasn’t the worst offender of the bunch, it definitely wasn’t the best.</p>
                    <p>You can <a href="../files/Math-Adventure-Comparative-Summary.pdf">view a summary of my analysis</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GrHUmVadHCUtfUeLMqjviJtJ-p2C5w9Smrg6i6ZEo3Q/edit?usp=sharing">the work that went into it.</a></p>

                   <h3>Content Audit</h3>
                       <p>I took a closer look at assessing the quality of each page through a content audit and heuristics, keeping in mind the personas of the site and the business goals for Math Adventure.</p> 
                        <p>I felt that the site could be improved upon by consolidating duplicate pages, focusing on the messaging of its blog posts, and having clearer calls to action.</p>
                    <p>You can <a href="../files/Content-Audit-Summary.pdf">view a summary of my audit</a>, and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K0zeqYMmS-0hE0F9EW9Fv66fYx_4dwJv73CWg3vgkJk/edit?usp=sharing">Excel groundwork for it.</a></p>
                    
                    <h3>Final Report (Page Description Diagrams, Page Tables)</h3>
                    <p>I wrote a report with the final recommendations I would give if the client were to read these suggestions. Little did I know that my professor would actually send my recommendations onward to the client.</p>
                <p>You can <a href="../files/final-report.pdf">view my report</a>, as well as the <a href="../files/page-description-diagrams.pdf">page description diagrams</a> and <a href="../files/page-tables.pdf">page tables</a> I created.</p>
                    
                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                   <ul>
                       <li>I would love to have two monitors to do anything Excel related.</li>
                       <li>A tweet per 10 pages of content inventory can act as surprising motivation to get through it.</li>
                       <li>You don't need to reinvent the wheel. Learn from what other people (or organizations) are doing.</li>
                       <li> WIX is terrible for SEO.</li>
                       <li>A good picture goes a long way.</li>
                   </ul>
